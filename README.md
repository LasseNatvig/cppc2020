# cppc2020

* This folder contains the example programs used in the TDT4102 course lectured at NTNU - Trondheim in Norway in the **spring semester 2021.** The course was given from January to April year 2021, for about 1100 students.  We were using the PPP book (2nd edition) by Bjarne Stroustrup, but not all of that book was covered by the course.
  * Comments are appreciated, and should preferrably be e-mailed to me. 
* Detailed video lectures in Norwegian for all examples programs are available from [https://folk.idi.ntnu.no/lasse/cppc/]
* **NOTE: students following course TDT4102 spring 2022 or later should primarily follow the examples from _that_ course**. The information here is only ment as secondary optional material.
