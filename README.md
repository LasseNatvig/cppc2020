# cppc2020

* This folder contains the example programs used in the TDT4102 course lectured at NTNU - Trondheim in Norway.
* The course is given from January to April year 2020, for approximately 900 students.  We are using the PPP book (2nd edition) by Bjarne Stroustrup, but not all of that book is covered by the course.
* Copies of the slides used will be posted here during or after the course.
  * Comments are appreciated, and should be e-mailed to xxx@computer.org, where xxx is replaced with my first name.
